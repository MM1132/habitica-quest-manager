## Done
- Make a tutorial for anyone to be able to set up any version of the script they want, using `git` and `clasp`. 
- Show the rewards for the quests
- Fix the project name and versioning
- Update Habitica API to V3

## Todo
- If making a copy of the quest does not work, go to `script.google.com`
- Ask the user to repeat the password in the initial setup
- Automatically join quests option

- Quest queue

- Tab to show all quests of your party. Separate the ones that can already be started from the quest manager, and the ones that would require more members to install the Quest Manager script
- Setting for whether to sort quests alphabetically, or by rewards
- Possibly add metrics system to know how many people actually use the Awesome Quest Manager app

- API support
