## Done for v1.5
- Update Habitica API from v4 to v3 for more stability
- Tab buttons being disabled while page is loading

## Requirements for Quest Queue
- Option in the Settings to turn Quest Queue on/off
- Ability to set/remove webhooks
- Setting the webhook for when quest is finished
- Making sure that the webhook is indeed set
- Create the quest queue in the properties
- Once a quest finishes, automatically start the next one from the queue
- Able to add quests to the queue
- Order quests around in the queue
- Delete quests from the queue
- Change from which user's inventory the quest in the queue will be started from (possibly a dropdown next to the quest shown in the queue)
- Every time when opening the quest queue, make sure all the quests added to the queue actually exist in the inventories of the users. If they don't, or if the users have left the party or deleted their Quest Manager, automatically remove those quests from the quest queue. (or just display in the queue that the quest cannot be started and will be ignored by the Quest Manager, and therefore should be removed (display a red X in the corner to remove it manually))
- Possibly: Send a message in the party's chat every time a quest has been automatically started
- Also show the quest information in the quest queue about each quest in the queue when clicking on it
- Make sure that only party leaders are able to turn on the quest queue. 

## User Feedback
- We need Quest Queue! 
- "Quest Start Threshold" is confusing to understand
- Not sure how quests are sorted (Alphabetical would maybe make more sense)
- Add more info about the BOSS, such as HP

## Must for v1.5
- Complete all User Feedback
- Telemetry server to know who is using the tool

## Todo
- Disable/enable tab buttons while loading
- Quest queue
- If making a copy of the quest does not work, go to `script.google.com`
- Ask the user to repeat the password in the initial setup
- Automatically join quests option
- Explain in the Settings page what the Quest Start threshold is

- Tab to show all quests of your party. Separate the ones that can already be started from the quest manager, and the ones that would require more members to install the Quest Manager script
- Setting for whether to sort quests alphabetically, or by rewards
- Possibly add metrics system to know how many people actually use the Awesome Quest Manager app

- API support
- Voting system
- Send a notification (settings)

## In progress (not)
- SvelteKit
- Habitica is always very slow
